## Description

This project is an implementation exercise for jasmine for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree. In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and implemented unit tests in jasmine.


## How to Run

Download a copy of the project and open index.html in the web browser of your choice. Review the jasmine test results at the bottom of the page. Implementation of jasmine functions is located in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
